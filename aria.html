            <p>This project was a tangible example of product design. We created a 3D mockup of a proposed design, and a fully-functioning Arduino-based prototype. As such, I was mainly responsible for putting together the hardware prototype that we could plug into TouchDesigner.</p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <h4>Concept Sketches</h4>
            <p>This project started off with the overarching prompt of accessibility related to music. We could only use facial gestures—no hands, no arms.</p>
            <p>To brainstorm, we came up with a list of ideas in groups, did sketch sprints, and compared concepts. My group decided to go with one of my ideas, a wearable headpiece-instrument.</p>

            <h4>Building the Arduino</h4>
            <p>We wanted a functioning prototype. So we needed a functioning device.</p>
            <p>This project was my first time ever working with hardware, so I began by researching various Arduino boards and how they work, as well as what additional pieces we would need and how those work. The New Media Design program at RIT already had a selection of Arduino Unos, so I searched specifically for Uno-compatible parts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="boxes" style="align-items: flex-start;margin-top:-2rem;">
            <div>
                <h5>Fuctionality</h5>
                <p>Our device had to serve two main functions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>tracking jaw movement (open/close)</li>
                    <li>tracking head movement (nodding/shaking)</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h5>Parts</h5>
                <p>So I figured out two sensors that fit our needs:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>rotary/shaft encoder: tracks absolute or incremental angular movement of the axle</li>
                    <li>inertial measurement unit (IMU): multi-axis accelerometer and gyroscope; tracks translational and rotational movement</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>We managed to get the parts ordered, assembled, and functioning in less than a week.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="boxes">
            <img src="images/aria/arduino1.JPG" class="box3" alt="arduino picture">

            <img src="images/aria/solder.JPG" class="box3" alt="soldering the arduino">
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>I even had the opportunity to learn to solder, as the accelerometer pins came separately from the board. I managed to get it connected and functioning in my first try!</p>
            <p>While one of my teammates was mainly responsible for the software side of teh Arduino, I also helped with the mathematical/structural logic behind the C++ code: we kept track of how much position (in the accelerometer) and rotation (in the rotary encoder) deviated from the original neutral position, and scaled those values to work within the corresponding TouchDesigner ranges.</p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <h4>Prototype Video</h4>
            <p>This is footage of our functional, fully Arduino'd prototype, side by side with the live-reactive sound and art produced in TouchDesigner. Our logo design also came from a frame of the generative art.</p>
            <p>Make sure your sound is up!</p>

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Working with hardware was a delightful challenge! I enjoyed learning about the physicalities of design considerations, as well as some of the physics behind how the sensors we used function.</p>
            <p>I also learned the importance of task delegation, time management, and communication. Some aspects of the design were more intense and time-consuming than others. Mine was not one of them, which meant I ended up waiting with nothing to do and no one to help. (I ended up just making the pitch/process deck.)</p>
            <p>Overall, this project was a worthwhile endeavor both technically and creatively, allowing me a glimpse into physical product design and engineering.</p>
