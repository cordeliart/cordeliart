            <h1>Slaughterhouse-five Dust Jacket</h1>
            <h2>2021 | Adobe Illustrator, 40x17"</h2>
            <p>Kurt Vonnegut's <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> is one of my favorite novels. For these book covers, I focused on reflecting the balance of mature content and fantastical metaphors. After many sketch iterations, I developed this dichotomy in three different styles to create three contrasting book covers.</p>
            <p>All three covers utilize green or red, which I chose because of the Tramalmadorians and violence of war, respectively. </p>

            <p style="margin-top:10%">The leftmost cover was the most inspired and most visually captivating, and I chose that as my final version to develop into a complete dust jacket with original graphics and text.</p>
            <p>The first version features the blurb on the back and the quote on the first flap, as was required for the assignment. I made another version where it is the reverse, because I preferred the visual impact and minimalism that comes from the negative space on the back cover.</p>
