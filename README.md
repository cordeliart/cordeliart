- Hi, I'm @cordeliart / Lena Pang.
- I'm interested in design (graphic, interactive, multimedia, you name it), math, and traveling! I've been studying Japanese for a little over 2 years now, and I hope to visit soon.
- I'm currently studying for my Bachelor's in New Media Design at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York.
- How to reach me: www.cordeliart.com (this respository!) or lenacordeliart@gmail.com.
