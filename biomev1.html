            <h1>Biome V1</h1>
            <h2>23 June - 23 July 2020 | Adobe Illustrator, 2.5x3.5" x56</h2>
            <p>Over the course of the pandemic, I designed a deck of cards to reflect the beauty of nature--of the world we all dearly missed.</p>
            <p>Each suit is a different biome with a unique color scheme.<br>Each card is a different species within that biome.<br>And each deck is 56 pieces of art tucked neatly into a box.</p>
            <div class="grid">

                    <h3>The Process</h3>
                    <p style="margin-top:0">begins with research and quick study-sketches, aiming to capture the character and movement of each animal.</p>
                    <p>Then I do various pose digital pose sketches, working through several compositions to find the best one.</p>
                    <p>Finally, it comes time to render in Adobe Illustrator, using the colors and gradients I've determined for each suit.</p>
                    <p>Once I finished all 56 illustrations, I compiled everything (including the numerals and custom suits) into an AI document with the proper formatting for print.</p>

                    <h3>The Campaign</h3>
                    <p style="margin-top:0">After beginning to design the deck, word spread among friends and family about my upcoming creation, and demand gradually increased. So I decided to create a Kickstarter to see if I could fully realize my vision, and have Biome V1 printed in high quality, in large quantities.</p>
                    <p>The campaign ran from June 23rd to July 23rd, 2020, and successfully raised $6,844.</p>
                    <p>This allowed me to print over 1,000 decks through US Playing Card Company b6(the creator of the traditional Bicycle decks)--and distribute over 500 that were preordered during the campaign.</p>
                    <p>You can view the Kickstarter, and even purhcase a deck of your own, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cordeliart/biome-v1">here</a>.</p>
